About
=====

`jscribble` is a graphical notepad with as many pages as you want. You can
organize your notes within notepads. Best used with a graphics tablet or
touchscreen.

Taking notes on paper allow you to draw and write whatever you want. Some
people are fast enough in LaTeX to set complicated formulas while in a lecture.
Some prefer to draw these by hand but do not like carrying lots of paper with
me.

`jscribble` offers screen based note taking with as many pages as you want.
[`Xournal`](http://xournal.sourceforge.net/) offers more features but is paper
size oriented which does not make sense on a 10" netbook screen where one wants
to use the whole screen for taking notes.

Another focus was set to avoid any mouse navigation. All you can do with your
mouse (or pen) is draw, therefore you cannot click anything accidentially.
Navigation is done with the keyboard.


Controls
========

You can flip the pages with the arrow keys, down and right advance a page, up
and left go one page back. Go to the first and last page with `f` and `l` keys,
respectively.


TODO
====

- add extra exit button, maybe "q"
- save everything no matter how the application is exited
- better build system
